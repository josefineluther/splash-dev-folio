            I'm a frontend developer focused on creating clean, functional web experiences. With expertise in modern frameworks and a minimalist approach to
            design, I build applications that are both beautiful and purposeful.
          </p>

          <p>
            My work emphasizes simplicity, attention to detail, and user-centered design. I believe the best interfaces are the ones that feel natural and
            effortless.
          </p>

          <p>
            I study Frontend Development at IT-Högskolan in Gothenburg, Sweden. When I'm not coding, I enjoy crocheting, singing and spending time with my
            family and my cat.
